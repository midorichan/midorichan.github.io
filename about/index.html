<div class="story">
	<p>I studied System Engineering early in my career, and then switched to Graphic Design, lured by the creativity and the impact that visual can have on people's everyday life.</p>
	<p>Before becoming a UX designer, I worked very closely with people (as a tech support rep), and as a QA Analyst. This background has helped me to understand people and their frustrations, to become a better listener, to empathize, and to want to channel all my energy towards making the experience count in the design of any product.</p>
	<p>I had always been curious as to how to improve things in a very "Don-Norman-dy" sort of way, an when the User Experience facet of design became a discipline <p>I knew I had to be on that train. My past in sys engineering, and then in design, has given me a great mix to base my UX career on.</p>
	<p>With time, I discovered that I enjoyed researching and getting insights to provide a solid base to ground the designs on, and I'm gradually changing my focus towards that area of UX.</p>
