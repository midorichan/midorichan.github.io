	<p>My name is <strong>Paula Alonso Ishihara</strong> and I'm an experience designer. I've been working in the tech industry for more than 10 years, and around half of that time I've been designing.</p>

	<h3>A brief intro about MIDORICHAN</h3>
	<p>Midorichan is my nickname. I was named Midori「緑、みどり」 by my japanese grandparents, its meaning is: <a href="http://jisho.org/search/midori" target="_blank"><em>green</em></a>. Over the years it has become part of my identity and my heritage.</p>

	<h3>Some background</h3>
	<p>I studied System Engineering early in my career, and then switched to Graphic Design, lured by the creativity and the impact that visual can have on people's everyday life. But I couldn't stop there: I have always been insatiably curious, with a thirst for improvement for practically everything I found in my way, so when I came across experience design I knew it was the right job for me.</p>

	<p>Before becoming a UX designer, I worked very closely with people &#40;as a tech support rep&#41;, and as a QA Analyst. This background has helped me to understand people and their frustrations, to become a better listener, to empathize, and to want to channel all my energy towards making the experience count in the design of any product.</p>

	<p>My past in sys engineering, and then in design, has given me a great mix to base my UX career on, and a solid foundation to become a full-stack designer.</p>
	
	<p>You can find me online pretty much everywhere as <strong><em>midorichan</em></strong> &#40;unless taken &#128557;&#41;, but here are some shortcuts:</p>
